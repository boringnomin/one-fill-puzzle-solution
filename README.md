# one-fill-puzzle-solution

This puzzle is one of finding the path type. Normally finding shortest path is what people looking for. One Fill (or) One Line Puzzle is here for you, find the longest path to reach the destination.

Why only the solution code? Because of the lack of knowledge, I am bored to do find the unique patterns of graph for the puzzle questioning state, therefore, you can get the real puzzle in hand with this link https://www.xpgameplus.com/games/trace/index.html.

I used "Hamiltonian Cycle" from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hamiltonian-cycle-backtracking-6/ 

For the thanks - Hamiltonian Cycle explain - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQr4wZCiJJ4, Snake Ai - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOpBcfbAgPg

Actually this is pretty good, You know , from another view point this program is checking if your graph unique hamiltonian path or not!!!

Haha
